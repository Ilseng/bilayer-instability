[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/223383221.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/223383221)

## What is it?
This repo holds scripts for solving the stability of a hydrogel bilayer under equilibrium swelling. 

The implementation is based on the paper
Wu et al., International Journal of Solids and Structures, 2013
http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijsolstr.2012.10.022

## Usage
The code is written for Python 3.6 and requires numpy, scipy, and matplotlib. 
The main.py file runs the code while the bilayer_lpa.py file contains the functions.
